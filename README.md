## Rinkeby Testing

**Rinkeby faucet for sOHM:**
[Lives here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x800B3d87b77361F0D1d903246cA1F51b5acb43c9#writeContract), to retrieve test sOHM click `Connect to Web3` and use function #3: `dripSOHM`. After connecting to web3, click `Write` to execute and 10 sOHM will automatically be transferred to your connected wallet.

Note: The faucet is limited to one transfer per wallet every 6500 blocks (~1 day)

**Rinkeby faucet for WETH:**
[Wrap rinkeby eth on rinkeby uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)

**Rinkeby faucets for LUSD, FRAX & DAI can be taken from rinkeby etherscan:**

1. Go to `src/helpers/AllBonds.ts`
2. then copy the rinkeby `reserveAddress` for the applicable bond & navigate to that contract on rinkeby etherscan. 
3. On Rinkeby etherscan use the `mint` function. You can use the number helper for 10^18 & then add four more zeros for 10,000 units of whichever reserve you are minting.

## Avax Fuji Testnet
1. [avax faucet](https://faucet.avax-test.network/)
2. [explorer](https://explorer.avax-test.network/)

## Architecture/Layout
The app is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as the state container. 

The files/folder structure are a  **WIP** and may contain some unused files. The project is rapidly evolving so please update this section if you see it is inaccurate!

```
./src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.jsx       // Main app page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ abi/          // Contract ABIs from etherscan.io
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actions/      // Redux actions 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/       // Static assets (SVGs)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/   // Reusable individual components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ constants.js/ // Mainnet Addresses & common ABI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contracts/    // TODO: The contracts be here as submodules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ helpers/      // Helper methods to use in the app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/        // Shared reactHooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ themes/       // Style sheets for dark vs light theme
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ views/        // Individual Views
```

## Application translation

Olympus uses [linguijs](https://github.com/lingui/js-lingui) to manage translation.

The language files are located in a submodule deployed in `src/locales/translations`. This submodule points to the [olympus translation repository](https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-translations)

In order to mark text for translation you can use:
- The <Trans> component in jsx templates eg. `<Trans>Translate me!</Trans>`
- The t function in javascript code and jsx templates. ``` t`Translate me` ```
You can also add comments for the translators. eg.
```
t({
	id: "do_bond",
	comment: "The action of bonding (verb)",
})
```


When new texts are created or existing texts are modified in the application please leave a message in the OlympusDao app-translation channel for the translators to translate them.

## üöÄ Deployment
Auto deployed on [Fleek.co](http://fleek.co/) fronted by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Since it is hosted via IPFS there is no running "server" component and we don't have server sided business logic. Users are served an `index.html` and javascript to run our applications. 

_**TODO**: TheGraph implementation/how/why we use it._


### Continuous deployment
Commits to the follow branches are automatically deployed to their respective URLs.
| Branch | URL |
| --- | --- |
| master | https://app.olympusdao.finance |
| deploy | https://staging.olympusdao.finance |

**Pull Requests**:
Each PR into master will get its own custom URL that is visible on the PR page. QA & validate changes on that URL before merging into the deploy branch. 


## üëèüèΩ Contributing Guidelines 

We keep an updated list of bugs/feature requests in [Github Issues](https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympusdao/issues). 


![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/olympusdao/olympusdao?style=flat-square)

Filter by ["good first issue"](https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympusdao/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) to get your feet wet!
Once you submit a PR, our CI will generate a temporary testing URL where you can validate your changes. Tag any of the gatekeepers on the review to merge them into master. 

*__NOTE__*: For big changes associated with feature releases/milestones, they will be merged onto the `develop` branch for more thorough QA before a final merge to `master`
